Polynomial
========

Polynomial is a high-level language whose syntax is similar to that of JavaScript
and it is designed to compile to code for the Sophon Virtual Machine.
As you will see, it is quite easy to create contracts for voting,
crowdfunding, blind auctions, multi-signature wallets and more.

.. note::
    The best way to try out Polynomial right now is using the
    `Browser-Based Compiler <https://chrissof.github.io/browser-polynomial/>`_
    (it can take a while to load, please be patient).

Language Documentation
----------------------

On the next pages, we will first see a :ref:`simple smart contract <simple-smart-contract>` written
in Polynomial followed by the basics about :ref:`blockchains <blockchain-basics>`
and the :ref:`Sophon Virtual Machine <the-sophon-virtual-machine>`.

The next section will explain several *features* of Polynomial by giving
useful :ref:`example contracts <voting>`
Remember that you can always try out the contracts
`in your browser <https://chrissof.github.io/browser-polynomial>`_!

The last and most extensive section will cover all aspects of Polynomial in depth.

If you still have questions, you can try searching or asking on the
`Sophon Stackexchange <https://sophon.stackexchange.com/>`_
site, or come to our `gitter channel <https://gitter.im/susy-lang/polynomial/>`_.
Ideas for improving Polynomial or this documentation are always welcome!
