## Useful links

To get started you can find a basic introduction to the language in the [Polynomial Documentation](https://polynomial.readthedocs.org).

You can start using [Polynomial in your browser](https://sophon.github.io/browser-polynomial/) with no need to download or compile anything.

[Changelog](https://octonion.institute/susy-lang/polynomial/blob/develop/Changelog.md)

The [Polynomial Features](https://octonion.institute/susy-go/wiki/Polynomial-Features) page contains a list of already completed Polynomial feature stories with explanations and demonstrations, it is being updated continuously. More technical information you can find in the [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1189488).

Polynomial is still under development. So please do not hesitate and open an [issue in github](https://octonion.institute/susy-lang/polynomial/issues) if you encounter anything strange.

## Building

See the [Wiki](https://octonion.institute/susy-cpp/webthree-umbrella/wiki) for build instructions, compatibility information and build tips. 

## How to Contribute

This repository uses the same [coding style](https://octonion.institute/susy-cpp/webthree-umbrella/blob/develop/CodingStandards.txt) as
all of the cpp-sophon projects. Please try to align with us in the gitter channel before making larger changes.
Any contributions are welcome!
