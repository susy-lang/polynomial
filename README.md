# The Polynomial Contract-Oriented Programming Language
[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/susy-lang/polynomial](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/susy-lang/polynomial?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)
## Useful links

To get started you can find a basic introduction to the language in [Polynomial Tutorial](https://sophon.github.io/polynomial/docs/home/).

You can start using [Polynomial in your browser](https://chrissof.github.io/browser-polynomial/) with no need to download or compile anything. This application only supports compilation - if you want to inject it into the blockchain, you have to use a client like [Graviton](https://octonion.institute/susy-go/susy-graviton/wiki) or [AlsofZero](https://octonion.institute/susy-cpp/alsofzero).

Also check out more documentations for [Polynomial ABI](https://octonion.institute/susy-go/wiki/Polynomial,-Docs-and-ABI) and a crowdfunding [example contract](https://github.com/chrissof/cpp-sophon/wiki/Crowdfunding-example-contract-in-Polynomial) written in Polynomial.

[Changelog](https://octonion.institute/susy-go/wiki/Polynomial-Changelog)

The [Polynomial Features](https://octonion.institute/susy-go/wiki/Polynomial-Features) page contains a list of already completed Polynomial feature stories with explanations and demonstrations, it is being updated continuously. More technical information you can find in the [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1189488).

Polynomial is still under development. So please do not hesitate and open an [issue in github](https://octonion.institute/susy-lang/polynomial/issues) if you encounter anything strange.

## Building

See the [Wiki](https://octonion.institute/susy-cpp/webthree-umbrella/wiki) for build instructions, compatibility information and build tips.
