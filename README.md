[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/susy-lang/polynomial](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/susy-lang/polynomial?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

## Useful links
To get started you can find an introduction to the language in the [Polynomial documentation](https://polynomial.readthedocs.org). In the documentation, you can find [code examples](http://polynomial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/polynomial-by-example.html) as well as [a reference](http://polynomial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/polynomial-in-depth.html) of the syntax and details on how to write smart contracts.

You can start using [Polynomial in your browser](https://sophon.github.io/browser-polynomial/) with no need to download or compile anything.

The changelog for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/susy-lang/polynomial/blob/develop/Changelog.md).

Polynomial is still under development. So please do not hesitate and open an [issue in GitHub](https://github.com/susy-lang/polynomial/issues) if you encounter anything strange.
